# Tests for QuestionAnsweringService
# 
# Note: Previous tests for _determine_answer_status were removed as that method
# is deprecated. The LLM now returns structured responses with status included.
#
# TODO: Add tests for current LLM-based question answering architecture:
# - Test structured response parsing
# - Test business logic that applies LLM decisions
# - Test integration with update_question_status method
